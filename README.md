# MarkdownView Cross-Platform for React Native

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-native-markdown-view.svg)

A straight-forward React Native component for rendering Markdown as native views.

This library is backed by [simple-markdown](https://github.com/Khan/simple-markdown).

## Original version
This library is based on https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/react-native-markdown-view. Although the original version works great on iOS, it does not work on Android due to missing fonts. Since I needed this package for a school project, MarkdownView Cross-Platform will continue as a fork.
